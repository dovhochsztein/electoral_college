# electoral_college

we all know the electoral college allows victory in the presidential ellection with shockingly weak performance in the popular vote do the winner-take-all aspect in each state
this is true EVEN if we limit to just two candidates
if we consider a collection of states all with the same number of electoral votes and the same population and all operating on winner-take-all,
then intuitively, if the number of states is large enough, the fraction of the popular vote needed to win is ~25% -
i.e. winning just over half the states with just over half the votes in each and losing the remaining states without getting any votes
but what about with the US states as they currently are? with disproportionate number of votes, what's the least you can get and still win?

here is an algorithm to efficiently test all possibilities and find the best outcome (2019 population data)

the best solution is ~21.7% of the votes. An image generated from 270towin.com shows the solution
